fn main() {//in rust the main function is the entrypoint of the program 
    //to define a fucntion we use the fn keyword example: fn testFunction(){}
    // Statements here are executed when the compiled binary is called.
    // Print text to the console.
    println!("Hello World!");//the println keyword will make a new line
    print!("Hellow World this is using the print keyword"); //in rust we need to use semicolon to terminate a line
}

//to compile we use the rustc first.rs
